## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dang Quang, or Quang Ba Hai Dang (in Vietnamese). I am currently a postgraduate student at RMIT majoring in Artificial Intelligence. I am currently looking for a research or applied research position.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working toward improving Image Generation evaluation methods for embedding complex information in its generative output.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) with my main focus on Computer Vision (CV) in generative applications.
- ðŸ¥‹ I have been training in martial arts for a large portion of my life; right now, my main focus is in Brazillian Jiujitsu (BJJ).
- ðŸ”Ž I'm highly curious and believe there is no such thing as useless knowledge. Useless knowledge is knowledge that has not yet found its time.

Fun fact: I have never lived more than seven years in one city, and the last time I was in one such city was in Melbourne, Australia.
The best way to reach me is through my email. I would love to connect with like-minded individuals to have interesting conversations and to work on interesting projects.
