## Hi there 👋

My name is Dang Quang, or Quảng Bá Hải Đăng (in Vietnamese). I am currently a postgraduate student at RMIT majoring in Artificial Intelligence. I am currently looking for a research/data science position either in industry or academic.

- 🔭 I’m working toward improving Image Generation evaluation methods for embedding complex information in its generative output.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) with my main focus on Computer Vision (CV) in generative applications.
- 🥋 I have been training in martial arts for a large portion of my life; right now, my main focus is in Brazillian Jiujitsu (BJJ).
- 🔎 I'm highly curious and believe there is no such thing as useless knowledge.

Fun fact: I have never lived more than seven years in one city, and the last time I was in one such city was in Melbourne, Australia.
The best way to reach me is through my email. I would love to connect with like-minded individuals to have interesting conversations and to work on interesting projects.
