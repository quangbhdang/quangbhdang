## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dang Quang, or Quang Ba Hai Dang (in Vietnamese). I am currently a postgraduate student at RMIT majoring in Artificial Intelligence.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working toward a way to improve Image Generation evaluation methods for embedding complex information in its generative output.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Deep Learning (DL), Machine Learning (ML) and Computer Vision (CV).
- ðŸ¥‹ I have been training in martial arts for a large portion of my life, now my latest one is BJJ.

Fun fact: I never lived more than 7 years in one city, and the last time I was in one such city was in Melbourne Australia.
The best way to reach me is through my email. I would love to connect with like-minded individuals to have interesting conversations and to work on interesting projects.
